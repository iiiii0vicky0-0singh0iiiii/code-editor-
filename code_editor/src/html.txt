==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*html-intro*

To start, you should familiarize yourself with Vim enough to know the
terminology, and you should know HTML to some degree.

The mappings are local to the buffer the script was sourced from, and the menu
and toolbar are active only for buffers the script was sourced from.

This help file follows the Vim help file standards.  To see what modes a
mapping works in see the tags between the **'s.  For example, the |;;| mapping
below works in normal, insert mode and visual mode.

In the descriptions of the mappings I often use <CR> to mean a literal
newline.

							*html-smart-tag*
Noted tags are "smart"--if syntax highlighting is enabled it can be used to
detect whether to close then open a tag instead of open then close the tag.
For example, if the cursor is in italicized text and you type ;it, it will
insert </I><I> instead of <I></I>.

This can not be done on most tags due to its dependence on the syntax
highlighting.

NOTE: Some tags are synonyms and Vim can not distinguish between them.  For
example, if you're within <I></I> and type |;em| it will assume you want
</EM><EM> rather than <EM></EM>, which you should not be doing anyway.

							*n_;;* *i_;;* *v_;;*
;;	Most of the mappings start with ; so ;; is mapped to insert a single
	; character in insert mode, behave like a single ; in normal mode,
	etc.  (The semicolons in this mapping are changed to whatever
	|g:html_map_leader| is set to.)

							*i_;&*
;&	The HTML |character-entities| insert mode mappings start with &, so
	typing ;& in insert mode will insert a literal & character.
	(In actuality this mapping is defined as |g:html_map_leader| +
	|g:html_map_entity_leader| to insert whatever is in
	|g:html_map_entity_leader|.) (Also see |n_;&|)

				*html-<Tab>* *html-tab* *html-CTRL-I*
				*i_html-<Tab>* *i_html-tab* *i_html-CTRL-I*
				*v_html-<Tab>* *v_html-tab* *v_html-CTRL-I*
<Tab>	If the cursor is on a closing tag the tab key jumps the cursor after
	the tag.  Otherwise the tab key will jump the cursor to an unfilled
	tag somewhere in the file.  For example, if you had the tag:
>
	 <A HREF=""></A>
<
	And you hit tab, your cursor would be placed on the second " so you
	could insert text easily.  Next time you hit tab it would be placed on
	the < character of </A>.  And the third time you hit tab the cursor
	would be placed on the > of </A>, and so on.  This works for tags
	split across lines, such as:
>
	 <TABLE>
	 </TABLE>
<
	Currently using this mapping in visual mode clears the visual
	selection.

	See |g:no_html_tab_mapping| if you do not want these mappings to be
	defined, in which case ;<Tab> will be used for the mappings instead.

	[I think the use of tab is acceptable because I do not like the idea
	of hard tabs or indentation greater than one or two spaces in HTML.]

					*i_;<Tab>* *i_;tab* *i_;CTRL-I*
					*n_;<Tab>* *n_;tab* *n_;CTRL-I*
;<Tab>	To insert a hard tab (; then the tab key).  If |g:no_html_tab_mapping|
	is set this mapping replaces the normal |html-tab| mapping instead.
	(See |g:html_map_leader|)

								*n_;html*
;html	This macro inserts a basic template at the top of the file.  If the
	buffer already contains some text you are asked if you want to replace
	it or add the template anyway.  (See |g:html_map_leader|)

	See |g:html_template| for information on how to customize the
	template.


	*disable-HTML-macros*	*HTML-macros-disable*	*HTML-disable-macros*
	*disable-HTML-mappings*	*HTML-mappings-disable*	*HTML-disable-mappings*
*disable-HTML-mappings*	*HTML-mappings-disable*	*HTML-disable-aRT - code*
							*:HTMLmappings*
:HTML[mappings] {disable/off/enable/on/html/xhtml}
	This command allows the HTML macros to be disabled and re-enabled.
	This is useful for editing inline PHP, JavaScript, etc. where you
	would want to be able to type literal ";", "&" and tab characters
	without interference.  (Also see |;;|, |;&| and |;<Tab>|)

	Note that all of the mappings defined by calling |HTMLmap()| or
	|HTMLmapo()|--including all of the mappings defined by this
	script--are disabled/enabled when this command is used, regardless of
	what |g:html_map_leader| is set to.

	You may also use this command to switch the mappings into HTML or
	XHTML mode.

	The argument to this command can be abbreviated to the first character
	rather than the full word.

==============================================================================
2. Customization Variables		*html-variables* *html-configuration*
					*html-customization*

You can set the following global Vim variables to control the behavior of the
macros.  It is recommended you set these variables in your .vimrc--some of
them are only effective if they are set before HTML.vim is sourced.

Note that "nonzero" means anything besides "no", "false", 0, or "" (empty
value)--case insensitive.

*g:do_xhtml_mappings* *b:do_xhtml_mappings*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you prefer XHTML compatible tags to be
defined.  Setting this forces |b:html_tag_case| to "lowercase".  This is
automatic if you are already editing a file that Vim detects as XHTML.  This
variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced for the current buffer.  You
can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using b:do_xhtml_mappings instead.
e.g.: >
	:let g:do_xhtml_mappings = 'yes'

*g:html_tag_case* *b:html_tag_case*
This variable can be set to "l" / "lower" / "lowercase" or "u" / "upper" /
"uppercase" to determine the case of the text in the HTML tags.  This variable
must be set before HTML.vim is sourced for the current buffer.  The default is
"uppercase".  You can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using
b:html_tag_case instead.  This variable is ignored when editing XHTML files
(see |g:do_xhtml_mappings|).  e.g: >
	:let g:html_tag_case = 'lowercase'

*g:html_tag_case_autodetect*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you want to automatically detect what
the value of |b:html_tag_case| should be.  This is done by examining the file
for both upper and lower case tags (tag attributes are not examined).  If only
one type is found the tag case for the buffer is set to that value.  This
variable is ignored if you have set |g:do_xhtml_mappings|.  e.g.: >
	:let g:html_tag_case_autodetect = 'yes'

*g:html_map_leader*
This variable can be set to the character you want for the leader of the
mappings defined under |html-tags|, the default being ';'.  This variable must
be set before HTML.vim is sourced.  You can set this to your |mapleader| or
|maplocalleader|.  e.g.: >
	:let g:html_map_leader = g:maplocalleader

*g:html_map_entity_leader*
This variable can be set to the character you want for the leader of the
character entity insert mode mappings defined under |character-entities|, the
default being '&'.  This variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced.  If
you attempt to set this to the same value as |g:html_map_leader| you will get
an error.  e.g.: >
	:let g:html_map_entity_leader = '\'

*g:no_html_map_override*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want this plugin to
override mappings that already exist.  When this variable is not set you will
get a warning message when this plugin overrides a mapping.  This variable
must be set before HTML.vim is sourced.  e.g.: >
	:let g:no_html_map_override = 'yes'

This only applies to the mappings defined internally to the plugin.  If you
call the |HTMLmap()| function elsewhere you will still get a warning message
when there's an already existing mapping and the mapping will still be
overridden.

*g:no_html_maps* *b:no_html_maps*
Set this variable a regular expression to match against mappings.  If a
mapping to be defined matches this regular expression it will not be defined.
You can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using b:no_html_maps instead.
The patterns are case sensitive, will not undergo |g:html_map_leader| and
|g:html_map_entity_leader| substitution, and must be set before HTML.vim is
sourced.  e.g., to suppress the <A HREF>, <IMG SRC> and the centered headers
tags: >
	:let g:no_html_maps = '^\(;ah\|;im\|;H\d\)$'

This only applies to the mappings defined internally to the plugin.  If you
call the |HTMLmap()| function elsewhere the mapping will be defined even if it
matches this regular expression.  This is useful if you wish to define custom
variants of some of the plugin's mappings without getting warning messages.

*g:no_html_tab_mapping*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want the tab key to be
mapped in normal, visual and insert mode.  ;<Tab> will be used instead.  See
|html-tab| and |i_;tab|.  This variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced
for the current buffer.  e.g.: >
	:let g:no_html_tab_mapping = 'yes'

Note that you can suppress the defining of both <Tab> and ;<Tab> as a mapping
by adding "\t" to |g:no_html_maps| instead.

*g:no_html_toolbar*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want this plugin to modify
the Vim toolbar and add "T" to 'guioptions'.  This variable must be set before
HTML.vim is sourced.  e.g.: >
	:let g:no_html_toolbar = 'yes'

*g:no_html_menu*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you do not want the menu items to be
defined at all.  This implies that |g:no_html_toolbar| is set as well.  This
variable must be set before HTML.vim is sourced.  e.g.: >
	:let g:no_html_menu = 'yes'

*g:force_html_menu*
Set this variable to a nonzero value if you want the menu items to be defined
even if you're not in the GUI.  This is useful if you want to use the menus in
the console (see |console-menus|).  This variable is ignored if
|g:no_html_menu| is set.  This variable must be set before HTML.vim is
sourced.  e.g.: >
	:let g:force_html_menu = 'yes'

*g:html_template* *b:html_template*
Set this variable to the location of your template file to be used by the
|;html| mapping.  You can also set this on a per-buffer basis by using
b:html_template instead.  If unset, a basic internal template will be used.

See |html-template-tokens| for special tokens you can use within the template.

*g:html_authorname* *g:html_authoremail*
Within the internal template, html_authorname is inserted inside
<META NAME="Author" CONTENT="...">
g:html_authoremail is converted to |g:html_authoremail_encoded| and inserted
inside <LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:...">  e.g.: >
	:let g:html_authorname  = 'John Smith'
	:let g:html_authoremail = 'jsmith@example.com'

These two variables are also used for the <ADDRESS></ADDRESS> section of the
internal template.

The default for these variables are empty strings.

*g:html_authoremail_encoded*
This variable will be set using |HTMLencodeString()| if your
|g:html_authoremail| variable is set.  (Do not set this variable yourself, it
will be overwritten when the template macro is used.)

*g:html_bgcolor* *g:html_textcolor* *g:html_linkcolor*
*g:html_alinkcolor* *g:html_vlinkcolor*
These control the <BODY> tag in the internal template and can also be used as
|html-tokens| in the user defined template.  They default to: >
	:let g:html_bgcolor     = '#FFFFFF'
	:let g:html_textcolor   = '#000000'
	:let g:html_linkcolor   = '#0000EE'
	:let g:html_alinkcolor  = '#FF0000'
	:let g:html_vlinkcolor  = '#990066'

*g:html_default_charset*
This defaults to "iso-8859-1" and is the value used if a character set can not
be detected by the 'fileencoding' or 'encoding' options.  See |;ct| and
|html-tokens| for how this is used.  (Also see |html-author-notes|)

*g:html_charset*
If this variable is set it completely overrides the Content-Type charset
detection for the |;ct| mapping and in the |html-tokens|.  Normally this
should be left unset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					*html-template-tokens* *html-tokens*

When you define a template file with the |g:html_template| variable, special
tokens within the template will automatically replaced with their
corresponding variable value:

Token:			 Variable: ~
%authorname%		|g:html_authorname|
%authoremail%		|g:html_authoremail_encoded|
%bgcolor%		|g:html_bgcolor|
%textcolor%		|g:html_textcolor|
%linkcolor%		|g:html_linkcolor|
%alinkcolor%		|g:html_alinkcolor|
%vlinkcolor%		|g:html_vlinkcolor|
